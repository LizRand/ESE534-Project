This project is designed to run on MATLAB. Signal Processing Add-On is needed for a sucessful run. Working with PhD students at
Stony Brook University, we wrote MATLAB code that is designed to use their device MagSkin to measure the heartrate of a person.
The input file contains information regarding the position of the magnetic field of the device. The first three values in the input 
file are the x, y, and z postitions of the magnetic field from the MagSkin device. The next three values are the x, y, and z 
postiotns of the gyroscope or magnometer on the device (Android phone) that we were using to gather the data. The final value
in the input file is the datetime of recording the data. When running the code, the filename will have to have an updated path 
corresponding to where your data is stored. The input files that are attached are measurements for three people measuring their
heartrate at the wrist, temple, and neck.
